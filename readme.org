* Assembler tutorials

** Why
   I'm just running through some asm tutorials. I'm going to put code
   and links here, just because.

** nasmx macros
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/nasmx/
** syscall table
   https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl

** tutorials
   - https://github.com/0xAX/asm/blob/master/README.md
   - http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/
   - https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/introduction/basic_debugger_session.html


** Story
   These are some codes I'm doing with assembler as a way to remember
   and relearn some of its basics.

   I've followed some tutorials here and there, and then moved to
   experiment a bit with nasmx, which lifts assembler a bit towards a
   higher level language.

   - macros.asm is the file whic contains nasmx features.

   To debug these programs I started using [[http://rada.re/r/][radare's]] low level [[https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/introduction/basic_debugger_session.html][debugger]]
